This is a text-based version of the classic boardgame Checkers!

You can play with 0, 1, or 2 players! (0 Players is two bots fighting it out)

Just choose your piece, and this program will automatically find what moves you can make!

There are two ways to win:
1. Jump all of your opponent's pieces
2. Block your opponent from making any further moves

After every turn, the program saves the game state, so you don't need to worry about finishing a game in one sitting!

Additional Features:
- Auto-save
- Reset the board (enter R)
- Load the last save (enter L)
- Auto-load the last save (if detected)

Note:
- Kings and Jumping should work as intended; however, be prepared to encounter a few bugs.
- Double-jumping is not implemented at this time
